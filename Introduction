Hello Readers, if you are here reading this right now, I would assume you are having basic to Expertise level of Understanding of AEM (Adobe Experience manager). If I start off like this “Adobe experience manager is an enterprise grade web content management system which has wide variety of powerful features allowing you to organize your digital assets and content seamlessly” for people who have no knowledge on aem/cms or have minimum knowledge of aem couldn’t completely understand what/How & where AEM does work? I am that type of guy who doesn’t like to read bookish definitions, if I want to know about something I will try to clearly understand and most importantly relate it to the general stuff that happens in our lives, so I can remember it better and for long.
